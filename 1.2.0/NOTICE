Hear ye, hear ye.

At the moment, I have started a rewrite of this utility because
I realized that it was getting bloated with functionaity that wouldn't
be added. I was taking reference from Paige Ruten's 'kilo' tutorial
that becomes rather apparent once you look at the source code.
I already had a bit of worry out of following a tutorial of code and then
passing it off (or giving the impression at least) as my own code, even
if the two utilities have two different functionality.

I had reached a point in the tutorial where I would have to completely
redesign a data structure I had been using, and I had to sit back and
realize what I was essentially doing. The need to start over grew greater,
and I started to rationalize that decision, which actually didn't take much
willpower.

I had actually learned a lot from that tutorial, and anything I didn't know,
I felt that I could reasonably extrapolate. And with the writing of this,
I had decided to start over in a new version number. The version as of 1.2.0
is essentially complete, with some glaring bugs, but files read through the
utility are readable, and if this was the last terminal pager on the planet,
then it wouldn't be too bad.

So, the goals now are to be lightweight, using the capabilities of the newer
C++ standards to simplify data structures. This version shall be 1.2.5 because
version numbers make no sense. I will keep the code of the 1.2.0 version up
because I don't want to suddenly erase all of that progress and pretend it never
existed, plus it's a good way to measure just how I got here, if that makes
sense. Well, if you want to contribute to this version, then by all means go for
it. I'll be off making a better version.
