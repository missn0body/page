# page

'cause 'less' and 'more' are too good for me.
Made by anson.

### v.1.0.2

The original version of page that I wrote all
the way back when I didn't know as much as
I do now. It's limited, but presentable I
guess. I still chose to exclude it from this
repo.

### v.1.1.0
The definition of vainity, and the inducer
of humility. It's not at this repo, it's in 
folder hell on my personal computer where
it belongs. If it's lucky then it might get 
a public execution.

### v.1.2.0
This is the first version to be featured on
this repo, but was abandoned after the project
became too bloated with features that would
never be implemented since I was actually
following along with a tutorial for a text
editor. More information is found in the NOTICE
file in that folder. Otherwise, it is technically
finished as a version.

### v.1.2.5
This is the current version that I am working
on, from scratch and no tutorial this time. Again,
look at the NOTICE in the previous version's folder
for more information.
