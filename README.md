# page

'cause 'less' and 'more' are too good for me.
Made by anson.

### v.1.0.2

The original version of page that I wrote all
the way back when I didn't know as much as
I do now. It's limited, but presentable I
guess. I still chose to exclude it from this
repo.

### v.1.1.0
The definition of vainity, and the inducer
of humility. It's not at this repo, it's in 
folder hell on my personal computer where
it belongs. If it's lucky then it might get 
a public execution.
